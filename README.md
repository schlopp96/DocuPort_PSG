# DocuPort_PSG Version-1.0.0-Beta

---

> _A PySimpleGUI Online Documentation Portal_

[PySimpleGui](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an _excellent_ framework for building GUIs quickly, and with ease. Unfortunately, PSG doesn't have any _official_ offline documentation that can be easily downloaded. Instead, the documentation is hosted _online_, where it is changed and updated quite frequently - which is part of the reason the creator maintains the documentation online only.

As a result, users must go online anytime the documentation is needed, which is rather often as stated by the dev(s) themselves. So I decided to create a simple application that can
take users to specific areas of the online documentation quickly, and with the click of a
button. Thus, out of my own laziness and disdain for digging through webpages, **DocuPort_PSG** was born.
